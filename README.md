# Personal Website

This is the design of the server that constitutes my personal website. It uses
the gotty terminal on a docker container to serve up a simple but restricted
linux experience to the user, allowing the user to both view the website like
they might any other, but also providing restrictions against DOSing the server.

## Deploy Instructions:

To deploy update the config with your settings and enter ./deploy.sh.
