Hi, I am Alexandra Marie Miller and this is (obviously) my rather basic 
website. It was designed to allow the user to experience the various programs 
that I have made without having to install them on their systems with any 
dependencies or other requirements while also providing a unique website that is
enjoyable to explore and mess with.

The "blog" directory contains (poorly written) blog posts regarding my
experiences programming and life in general.

The "games" directory contains some basic games that I have written in a number
of languages along with the source code.These games were mostly developed either
while learning the languages they are written in or for personal enjoyment

The "lang" directory contains compilers/interpeters for the languages I have
written as well as the source code for them. The VMs used for the languages
are not duplicated in the "vm" directory.

The "misc" directory contains a variety of random programs for various tasks
that may or may not be at all useful. Some are destructive. Some are not.

The "vm" directory contains some virtual machines that I have written. They vary
in quality but tend to be better than the games. They all have primitive
assembly languages written for them, but nothing more.

If you notice any vulnrabilities in this website please send me an email 
describing it to webmaster@alexandra.systems and I will get on it as soon as I 
can. Feel free to poke around with it too, if you crash the thing the server 
will be nuked automatically should the system detect that the website has been
modified by an unauthorized user. Just please do not DOS the thing more than you 
need to confirm a vuln exists. Thanks for your compliance
